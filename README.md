# Virtual-Memory-Manager
A virtual memory manager program, this was the final project for an Operating Systems Fundamentals class.
The program translates logical to physical address for a virtual address space of 2<sub>16</sub> = 65,536 bytes. The program reads from a file containing logical
addresses and, using a TLB as well as a page table, translates each logical address to its corresponding physical address and outputs the value of the byte stored at the translated physical address.
